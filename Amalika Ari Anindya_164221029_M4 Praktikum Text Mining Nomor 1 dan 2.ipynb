funding construction facility store nuclear materials removed warheads dismantled   this essentially contribute overall design early phases construction storage facility   and finally     10 million

talk democracy corps   q private sector   many folks going involved   senior administration official   why n t i start democracy corps first   i think administration felt coming office literally thousands organization   private organizations united states one way another working goal trying achieve democratization russia   helping farmer to farmer basis   and literally 10 15 u s  government agencies variety programs area   and administration felt   president felt important try draw initiatives together one group give coherence efforts give impetus efforts   and presidential initiative

sector schools communities across nation   q kind commitment yet   kind word yet fy 94   new money needs appropriated besides   300 million president talked   senior administration official   the administration requesting additional funds fy 94   700 million   what president done weekend consult really intensively yesterday president yeltsin additional measures united states could take areas support reform   he  ll consulting congress   when returns washington    ll consulting also ally governments    ll make decision time   q two questions   700 billion agricultural money   first   i thought sort consensus russia need loans food   so decide way   secondly   could explain   agriculture stopped making loans food russia  s inability pay   how fit situation   senior administration official   as know   united states long time major supplier grains food commodities   agricultural products russia   i think 1991  92 extended   little bit history     5 5 billion credits   credit guarantees   commodity credit corporation   that principal vehicle ensure sale american grain products   on december 1 last year    92   russian government stopped payments program   they arrears us program   therefore   law   united states continue program   and president   working secretary espy officials cabinet   looked ways could promote american grain sales   and i think two ways   we  ve announced today   194 million grant food assistance food progress program   but sufficient authority spend   700 million grant food   looked concessional loan program   i think everybody agrees russia   short term loan program russia would make sense   long term concessional loan program would   and program   it provide   final details worked   six seven year grace period payments principal   and years seven 15   life deal   provide concessional rates interest   generally around three four percent   and believe russian government believes good deal avoid imperative early payments put years   also continue important grain relationship   important    s important american farm community   q i gather say could make explicit   russians   failure pay interest ecc loan way affect kind loan going   right   senior administration official   let explicit   we prevented law continuing commodity credit corporation short term credit program russia  s arrearages united states   all know arrearages   they total   i think   around   640 million   usda give exact figure   so taken consideration wanting preserve american market share long term grain relationship   wanting respond specific request russian government major food assistance   knowing could n t take grant programs n t sufficient authority   looked food progress   program  ve used great effect parts world   and consulted russian government arrived solution   i think russians pleased provides food   also gives little bit relief short term payments   q where funds actually come   senior administration official   they come food progress program   program usda  s authority   usda authority spend funds   we need go back congress funds   and i want make general point   everything package     1 6 billion package   comprises funds already allocated appropriated congress   the administration begin spend monies tomorrow   and  s important eyes expend funds year   meet commitments   and confident  ll able   q how arrive figure   700 million   max program   actually range 0   senior administration official   there  s reason   the reason russian government told us  s amount grain needed harvest time   and idea would begin shipments probably   100 million per month harvest autumn   time russia wo n t require level food imports west   q i would imagine  s going considerable envy jealousy part republics size scope russia   have given consideration advancing negotiations kinds projects ukraine   georgia   republics   senior administration official   yes    re conscience fact also interest extending american support 11 countries former soviet union   we told   planned area technical assistance   grant technical assistance see   roughly 50 percent funding go russia roughly 50 percent countries   in area food sales   active ukraine   grant food assistance georgia armenia   we continue   and i think  s fair say summit go back look programs countries ensure adequate productive  re hard hitting   q has anything happened summit lead american energy companies companies believe russia going user friendly toward terms taxing   legalities   bureaucracy   senior administration official   well   one primary objectives coming summit highlight   economic agenda   also trade investment   and i  d like refer point i made beginning   we  re convinced talking problem   problem support russia long term    re convinced collection western governments financial resources next decade fuel continuation reform   private sector   we look society see tremendous capability resources oil gas sector   it good match russians need   financial investment existing oil gas wells pipeline new technology new capital finance new production   that  s russian government told us wants    s made major emphasis   that  s trade investment prominent issue first day talks   fact   figured prominently last night meeting president yeltsin president clinton   and  re hoping together might send strong signal american business community support efforts invest russia   united states   ex  im opec department commerce   support   q my question   yeltsin position deliver making russia   senior administration official   we think   i would note president yeltsin  s prime minister   mr  chernomyrdin   worked 30 years russian oil gas sector   he chair high level commission vice president   vice president gore   try break barriers currently exist western investment oil gas sector   we believe commitment make committee important committee   and  re looking forward work   q what type mechanism already place administer private sector portion program   and u s  directly involved tail end distribution actual funds money simply turned russian government distribution   senior administration official   are talking variety programs listed   it depends program   in cases   though   either working american pbos american government agencies ensure money obviously well spent   money gets intended source   that  s obligation congress ensure money well spent account money   we done last couple months intensively continue programs   but quite different   for instance   area grant food medical assistance   grant food carried usda usda accounts delivery food   for grant medical assistance    ve working project hope private organization   for housing   instance   resettlement russian officers    ll working group american pbos   on democratization projects    re working directly russian private individuals private foundations   we  re working journalists russia media project may noticed   so literally 30 40 different activities rubrics  re going carried slightly different ways   some directly russian government   russian citizens   q the jackson vanik restrictions remain cocom restrictions remain   tell us president   senior administration official   well   george noted yesterday   president yeltsin raised irritants relationship   the president noted   i think  s fair say go back government return washington look questions    ll get back russian government   q you prepared questions got   senior administration official   we prepared questions   we  ve looked   but  re prepared make quick decision weekend   they require   let explain   particularly jackson vanik   they require consultation congress   they require consultation american jewish community   and  re sensitive concerns   and  ll want go back talk take action   q is package designed go congress anything point   senior administration official   as i said beginning   advantage particular package funds allocated appropriated congress   so administration go back congress seek additional authority fund efforts   in effect   begin tomorrow   i know many agencies responsible projects begin tomorrow   and  s advantage particular initiative   q if   president says   long term   long haul thing   members congress moment heading moscow   n t talking going congress suggesting president russia prepared go congress various things   senior administration official   i think  ve clear   the president discussing weekend president yeltsin additional ideas american funding additional projects   ideas   we major congressional delegation left last night   headed representative gephardt  ll want consult delegation members congress anything   and  ll also want consult allies   so  s stands   q we  ve told repeatedly number items represent different new ways spending money already appropriated   could tick items represents reprogramming least spending money ways previously set   senior administration official   i think  ve said projects either congress allocated money freedom support act   funds left fy 92   and administration took office new ideas funds might expended   we n t use freedom support act funds fy 92 funds   we went agency allocations   ex im   opic   usda   tried look creative ways programs   and example food progress concessional loans   we hit brick wall another type funding usda   we could go forward legally   looked creative way ensure continued american market share ensure continued grain sales   think found   q where   example   getting money russian officer resettlement   senior administration official   that  s freedom support act funds   q in words   money directly spent new ways   speak   senior administration official   most grant projects see   look general chart   second chart    s broken grant credits   and look grants   technical cooperation projects total   281 9 million   almost freedom support act funding   a little bit leftover funds fiscal year  92   the nunn lugar funds   course   know legislative history funds   q cooperation   senior administration official   from fy  92   i n t exact figure   it considerable figure   q could tell us please   anything happened weekend break log jam ukraine russia start   start i ii result  s happened   senior administration official   both presidents   president yeltsin president clinton   discussing issue morning   in fact   n t yet gotten security arms control related issues   that morning  s session   i know president clinton strongly reinforcing top priority us   we  ve talking russians ukrainians last couple weeks ways might help facilitate discussions   up point   important negotiation  s going essentially moscow kiev   and point essentially discussing ways could contribute discussion   help move things forward essentially   but terms coming weekend   i n t yet know   in couple hours  ll know   q   just follow up financing   is robbing peter pay boris   since  s current year appropriations   taken anyplace  s earmarked put fund   senior administration official   there smoke mirrors   i think  s important point note   we could given page assistance numbers included out year funding   we  re going make long term commitment many projects   instance   enterprise funds   privatization effort   housing effort   and  ve already talked russians long term commitment   we could put really big numbers could bigger package   wanted make point   this package fy  93   it  s funds   and  re going say  re going   and president feels strongly   in past legacy western governments   combination governments   put large budget figures number reasons  re able meet    re determined   president determined   carry every single program package   and  ll   but longer term commitment    s part discussions economics weekend   we  re looking russian ideas effectively support reform   and  ve told commitment programs beyond fiscal year   q taken way   senior administration official   no   n t   okay   question   reprogrammed funds   taken countries pay programs russia   the answer   done   q in terms funding   available monies left   simply find creative way find money somewhere else   does n t   fact   support   theory   senior administration official   not   i n t think   that  s particular example   example grain sales   the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program short term loans russia pay back within 12 15 months   you know russia  s debt problem   russia unable meet commitments   so looked way two things   meet russia  s requirement grain   they  re net grain importer massive scale   also meet objective making sure american farmers chance sell products russia   and simply look another way finance   and legislative authority   this program successful areas   we tried former soviet union   thought   q is n t really bush clinton aid package russia   since funds really first derived initiatives put forward president bush   senior administration official   no   i n t think  s fair characterization   a lot funds appropriated u s  congress 1991   1992   this administration took office inherited obligations bush administration made   but long six seven week review program   we decided meet commitments made previous administration   but gone well beyond funding enterprise fund   idea   idea filled program   there number attached   in grouping together projects trying make coherent whole privatization effort   i would say   another clinton initiative   further   listened russian government listened russian military told us resettlement officers important political economic social reasons   and president clinton responded   and making long term commitment beyond demonstration project  re going figure way much trying settle officers   i would also say president given impetus us agencies think much broadly democratization   experience comparative advantage lends russian experience   and calling creation democracy corps   another new initiative    re hopeful take resources private sector well american government   achieve objective   so i would characterize way   and know   i career civil servant   i last administration   i  m familiar last administration   and i would characterize clinton assistance package russia   q there  s lot criticism aid past gotten people   is anything outside ombudsman   guarantee money disappear  s administered russian government   senior administration official   i think   i know president senior officials government concerned american money spent wisely get source  s intended    s intended   and  re going take great care   aid state department take great care making sure funds expended properly  re reaching source   i would package simply package support solely russian government   some projects   especially democratization exchanges   going worked directly russian private individuals   businesses   the private enterprise support another example   senior administration official   if i could add word point regard ssd related programs   one area  ve looking   closely consideration actually using russian firms subcontracting kinds programs   they would working closely   course   american firms   would prime contractors   but fine example   i think     imaginative flexible approach toward getting funding grassroots level   ground russia   time ensuring spent efficiently purposes intended   q when would democracy corps start   exactly see happening   how would get ground   senior administration official   well   president today calling creation democracy corps   i think  s fair say  re going work framework next couple weeks   ambassador simons takes duties may 1st   but effect  ve already started   last couple weeks administration begun reach people private sector come us asking us help facilitate activities russia   and  ve said helpful   we  ve also tried kind coordinate much effective way activities government   we 10 15 agencies active russia one way another   we think makes sense draw together focus efforts   q excuse   how much   1 6 billion actually spent united states american made goods   senior administration official   i n t figures   perhaps could try work something next couple days   q this figure larger figure press   program grow yesterday result discussions   far mark   senior administration official   no   i think   unfortunately press little bit mark   i  m sorry say   no   package   president clinton put us work seven weeks ago package   and briefed intensively   he contributed lot intellectual leadership package   he contributed lot ideas package   and i think  s fair say rough package worked two weeks ago   we refining ever since   we spent couple days last week going russian government   embassy washington government moscow embassy   and  s evolving   but particular package together two weeks   q where yeltsin  s input   there much talk president wanted get yeltsin  s views specifically needed forth   is years   senior administration official   no    s   president yeltsin several occasions told us   instance   support creation private businesses important   resettlement russian military officers important   first foremost effort privatize state industries important   and try make centerpiece technical assistance part package   we listened   on privatization effort   working russian government months trying work details   so russian government programs involved every step way   but let get part question   the president also using weekend talk broader set initiatives might undertake   and  re looking ideas   the president brought ideas table   instance   energy environment housing   but  re looking russian ideas   we need consult congress   need consult allied governments also active   q there  s essentially nothing happened last day half measurably altered package came   senior administration official   this particular package   i said   worked ready two weeks ago   we since consulted russian government final stages development   weekend  ve primarily talked future   united states western countries support reform russia   base objective   q i noticed   money appropriated train bankers businessmen officers   can tell job training workers displaced privatization   senior administration official   you  re right   program train russian   young russians banking financial services united states   part housing initiative    s build housing units    s retrain russian officers retiring professions   q money job training workers whose jobs disappearing privatization   senior administration official   we yet allocated money   q why   q   6 million going build 450 housing units   is n t lot money per unit given western dollar buy former soviet union   senior administration official   if want housing right way    s building framework house    ve got think utilities   you  ve got think purchase land   you  ve got think sewage gas electricity forth   and  s also retraining   it  s enough put retired   officer coming   riga tallin vilnius house western russia   we think obligation try retrain officers well   this responding request russian government   q   6 million go retrain   senior administration official   that  s right   q are talking apartment buildings single   senior administration official   we  re talking single   individual dwellings   q you  re saying 450 families served   senior administration official   what i want   i thought i pointed earlier   demonstration project   what n t want   given experience germans turks italians building housing western russian   want leap huge amount money   what want work next couple months try figure american organizations private sector best way get job done   i noted long term commitment   and i would expect would put lot money future   but want wisely   want spend money wisely   q what program convinces protect russia  s reforms russia position may back money  re supposed pay back   especially considering debt problem   senior administration official   well   look   i think  s important note united states capability fuel continuation russian reform   it  s got collective western effort    re looking allies well   but beyond    s really russians going decide fate reform   we simply play role   feel obligation   consistent national interests   q did president say value u s  contribution would create security prosperity united states   so program   senior administration official   i think go back fundamental objective policy toward russia   want everything support continuation reform   we convinced reformers stay power    ll able continue drawdown nuclear forces   foreign policy cooperation economic interaction   three benefits united states reform russia   so  s simple question   you ca n t say program answer   it  s long term question make long term commitment   q and question russia  s ability repay   convinces  ll able pay seven 15 years   senior administration official   well   russian government made commitment repay    re hoping reform continues   continue improve oil gas sector earn additional hard currency revenues   russia position six seven years pay back loans   q substantial government to government loan  ve ever gotten russians   senior administration official   i n t want answer authoritatively   i n t go back 20 30 years   but last four five years   yes   previous way financed grain exports really ensure private bank loans   this different type effort   q government loans sector recall   i know n t done   senior administration official   i think  s fair say new unique effort  ',\n",

something  ll let know   and i  m suggesting senator dole accepted anything  ve talked  ve offered anything hard way   q what follow up discussions president dole   mr  stephanopoulos   i think senator mitchell going talk senator dole   q is threat     laughter     q did president say senator dole   right   number overall size   dole say president   i go high   did talk numbers   mr

dole speaking   was way organized   mr  stephanopoulos   not knowledge     q and president touch senators kohl feingold   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t think  s talked     q george   president considering palatable fact national sales tax instead haves continuously pay have nots   and going scrap proposed tax privileged   haves pay have nots   mr  stephanopoulos   the president believes deeply tax rates upper income americans   presented budget   go   and i think second half question   i  ll refer briefing yesterday   q george   subject accuracy information   suggested day stimulus package included money would solve water problem milwaukee   apparently true   it  s actually waste water money   mr  stephanopoulos   it  s waste water money wisconsin   could go milwaukee   q but would affect drinking water problem  s waste water money   right   mr  stephanopoulos   it would affect water treatment overall   q but implication statement day would help fix disease problem milwaukee   would agree  s case   mr  stephanopoulos   i  m sure specifics   i know goes overall water treatment wisconsin   q a leftover question morning     president find task force deliberating vat   mr  stephanopoulos   i  m sure exactly   i n t know   i assume came last   certainly time commented past two days ago   q so sometime since march 25th   mr  stephanopoulos   i think  s right   i n t know exact date   q george   president morning mentioned labor business groups vat tax   apparently   national association manufacturers talks perhaps vat tax okay replaces btu tax   so president feel perhaps might place tax  s proposed   totally addition taxes  s already proposed   mr  stephanopoulos   i think  ve said say vat point   i mean    s   considered health care working groups     the president n t made decisions beyond   q but would finance health care   would n t replace tax finances   would n t replace income tax   instance   mr  stephanopoulos   there discussions   q in terms getting vat tax congress   senator dole  s press release today said vat   tax day   do think   chance getting congress   would chance   mr  stephanopoulos   i idea   q is consideration whether put forward   mr  stephanopoulos   that would become consideration president decide   it  s consideration   q you said beginning briefing circumstances changed caused vat consideration   mr  stephanopoulos   yes   president referred morning   these groups came forward said something considered   q those circumstances changed   that  s difference emphatically ruled groups asked considered   mr  stephanopoulos   that  s said   q is true   mr  stephanopoulos   yes   q was   fact   understanding sin taxes would produce enough money health care benefits   mr  stephanopoulos   i  m going get deliberations   q but   george   mr  stephanopoulos   no   what consideration   president said   groups came forward said something ought consider   the working groups looking   q is thing  s changed since prior statement prior statement vat   mr  stephanopoulos   yes   q can explain groups   information got groups wanted   was reading newspaper groups make presentations   mr  stephanopoulos   i think groups   know   health care task force met dozens groups   q but president  s knowledge groups come forward   mr  stephanopoulos   i think referring coming working groups   obviously   also published positions newspapers   q have certain groups briefed group  s presentations   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t know  ve briefed   i mean   detailed briefings   i know working groups decided look pressed groups   q what kind arguments groups make persuasive enough president would change position enunciated previously   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t know    s  ve longstanding positions would good way finance health care   q the president n t aware longstanding positions   mr  stephanopoulos   he may level   obviously    s governor long time knows basic arguments vat tax   q what  re trying figure    re telling us change   thing affected change president  s attitude toward vat february   mr  stephanopoulos   the president  s attitude n t necessarily changed   i mean   made decision   q i know   president said table   so   and  re saying thing  s changed positions groups   except  re also describing longstanding positions   i n t see change   if groups n t change position  s made president   mr  stephanopoulos   well    ve made presentations health care task force   q there  s relationship fact sin taxes said   suggested february favored produce enough revenue finance   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t think ever suggested would produce revenue   q well   suggested thought appropriate ways finance health care   mr  stephanopoulos   he say   i n t know said anything refute   q but   fact   task force discovered would n t enough revenue taxes finance kind core benefits   mr  stephanopoulos   again   i n t think task force ever suggested would   q george   advocated vat tax   would break promise raise taxes middle class pay programs   mr  stephanopoulos   i ca n t comment hypothetical situation   q but promise   would promise raise taxes middle class pay programs prevent seeking vat tax   mr  stephanopoulos   the president made decisions vat tax   when    ll tell  ll explain implications   q which specific groups cite   business   labor otherwise   whose recommendations health care task force prompted consideration   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t specific   i n t   q george   tell us extend alternatives   instance   employer tax sin taxes financing options also still table options   mr  stephanopoulos   no   members task force representatives working groups said   looking wide variety options   i think ira magaziner said 20 different options consideration   but i  m going comment   q what  s scope   mr  stephanopoulos   i  m going comment     q what  s scope need   how much talking produced one combination   mr  stephanopoulos   that  s health care task force looking   q since  s going briefing miyazawa visit   two questions   one   generally president hope use meeting   specifically   task complicated japanese anger vancouver note

question note gave gracious complete answer asked question   the questions trade something certainly discussed prime minister president   there obviously trade imbalance japan u s  want something   q also comments prime minister made suggested united states come heavy terms trade   are going oblige   mr  stephanopoulos   i think president state views trade clearly views trade deficit clearly   i n t necessarily want agree characterization prime minister  s comments   q need specific export targets   specific numerical targets    s going discuss miyazawa   mr  stephanopoulos   they  re going broad discussion wide range trade issues   i n t want get specifics meeting   q why   q that  s crux issue   right   whether   president believe without specific numerical targets   really   said press conference   sort hopeless going change much   mr  stephanopoulos   the president believes must pressure japan turn trade imbalance around   i want get specifics would done   q but president believe stimulus package announced yesterday rectify imbalance   mr  stephanopoulos   i think   first   president wants get full briefing stimulus package prime minister miyazawa    ll make comment

said     it  s rather emotional response     mr  stephanopoulos   over emotional issue   q right   emotional problem   does white house condone kind remark   mr  stephanopoulos   i think secretary christopher  s remarks speaks   the president believes also deeply troubling situation  re trying find answers   q but specific     rather emotional response     specific term   mr  stephanopoulos   no   speaks   q in connection   n t seem numbers people killed moment   good american policy put decisions might made help boris yeltsin win referendum   mr  stephanopoulos   for example   q to take stronger action   take military action   air strikes   anything done   mr  stephanopoulos   the president believes must done push harder sanctions   he also   know   administration discussing lifting arms embargo   he believes appropriate ways increase pressure time   q what response critics would say u s  stymied trying help boris yeltsin retain presidency   mr  stephanopoulos   they  re wrong   we  re pressing hard serbs come negotiating table   we  re pressing hard increased sanctions    re talking allies arms embargo   q you putting great store vance owen getting people agree   now   vance owen said military force extent would acceptable   does change thinking   mr  stephanopoulos   clearly    re going listen whatever people put much time situation say   but point   president moving forward sanctions talking arms embargo   q a follow up dee dee comment morning   she said would able provide administration officials could document effect sanctions bosnia   are going able   anything   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t think  s said   q that  s exactly said   mr  stephanopoulos   i n t think  s true   but said   would look situation kind evidence provided bosnia   obviously   connections

 blood tests   put 75 000 iu vitamin a one week   dropped 25 000 iu next couple weeks   i also received zinc supplementation   since interrelate fairly complex ways doctor explained    s one  evil   orthomolecular specialists     i blood test three weeks later vitamin a normal   stopped vitamin a   except multi vitamin   supplement     made sure i maintain 50 000 iu day beta carotene   call carrot face         hopefully   elaine  s doctor take similar   careful approach supplements   i  m even reevaluating supplements i  m taking   example   niacin fairly large dosages   1 gram day   steve dyer good information sci med nutrition   if niacin second order improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergies   probably worth taking large dose long term risking liver damage   though i believe   based successful therapy sporanox   i definitely excessive growth fungus   unknown species   sinuses   i still want ask question   studies demonstrate candida   blooms   sinuses associated sinus irritation   sinusitis rhinitis       my sinus irritation reduced significantly one week sporanox new treatments implemented time   i noticeable gi track problems starting sporanox   days went away   considered normal     btw   doctor dug one medical reference books   sorry   ca n t remember one     found obscure comment dating back 1950  s stated people develop contained   non lethal non serious   aspergillis infestations   aspergiliosis   sinuses leading sinus inflammation symptoms   i  ll dig reference since relevant discussion   my doctor tested   i believe rast rast similar test   allergic response specificially candida albicans   i showed strong positive   another question   would everybody show strong positive test essentially useless   and   assuming true candida grow part way mucus membrane tissue   concentration exceeds threshold amount   could person tests allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptoms   mucus membrane irritation due body  s allergic response   as i said earlier post   one need rocket scientist   m d   degree ph d  biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis   btw   i  ll repost   dr  ivker   book     sinus survival     routinely given

  actually studies done    s certain standard   perspective   non study even considered     i agree appropriate studies done   take big   right   however   order convince funding agencies austere times open wallets   literally give evidence   acceptable evidence compete proposals paradoxically almost exact study needed funding   that   90   study even get funding   scientist national lab   i  m aware smaller funded projects     i  m afraid even dr  ivker 100 doctors got together   pooled practice  s case histories anecdotes compelling picture   approach funding agencies   would get nowhere   even able publish statistical results   it obvious comments doctors   decided   excessive yeast colonization gut sinuses leading noticeable non lethal symptoms exist   even tenable hypothesis

against nuclear war   topic   1   when falkland islands crisis began early month looked first like tempest teapot   for century half since 1833   islands controlled great britain   during entire time   british sovereignty falklands disputed argentina   there countless threats argentina seize islands   calls malvinas   threats always come nothing past britain never even gotten worried   the islands four times distant argentina cuba united states   much prize   after 150 years occupancy   falklands home fewer 2 000 british settlers lot sheep   in short   remote falkland islands hardly look like something fight   yet watching another crisis take place   we watching war erupts great britain argentina   the thatcher government acting forgotten usual preoccupation soviet threat nato  s doorstep   instead   britain throwing almost everything  s got argentina    aircraft carriers   cruisers   destroyers   submarines   assault ships   name   luxury cruise ships even commissioned turned troop

grown steadily past several weeks armada numbering 70   over two thirds entire royal navy already deployed south atlantic argentina   watching   lot people asking   what  s fight really   the popular answer suggested major media   oil     vast deposits oil known exist continental shelf argentina falklands   known nearly 10 years   in way explain timing sudden military offensive argentina month   oil explains even less argentine seizure south georgia island   south georgia island 800 miles east falklands known oil deposits anywhere near   compared south georgia   falklands island paradise   south georgia island covered rugged mountains   treacherous valleys   glaciers   semi permanent snow   most uninhabitable   on top   argentina absolutely legal historical claim south georgia island   in respect stands sharp contrast falklands   in early 1830s falklands occupied argentine colonists   in 1833 british expelled took island   for historical reasons   argentina argues falklands really belong argentina   britain   but argument possible south georgia island   it always controlled britain   never argentina spain   the argentine seizure south georgia island looks even unreasonable military point view   argentina  s leaders military men think military terms   they well aware ahead time far off south georgia island could possibly held long   by seizing setting absorb military defeat   island retaken britain   so question   why argentina  s military junta bother seemingly worthless south georgia island   my friends   answers questions military   political economic   south georgia island possesses enormous military secret   it  s giant underground installation buried mountains northwest end island   the real reason so called falkland crisis secret installation   together two similar installations i describe shortly   the secret military complexes existence many years   new   what new accelerated nuclear war timetable american bolshevik war planners washington

together race time try head bolshevik war plan   last month i mentioned bolsheviks benefitting war preparations started rockefellers long ago   it three years since rockefellers dislodged prime movers united states government bolsheviks   since time united states government house divided   torn internal power struggles rival bolshevik rockefeller factions   but   united states dominated decades economically politically four rockefeller brothers   in 1961 brothers launched new long range plan world domination   it two prong strategy   half visible half secret   i first described long ago audio letter no   28   it plan united states arm teeth secret appearing disarm gradually   without repeating details   basic idea grandiose yet simple   by deliberately appearing weak   rockefeller controlled united states would maneuver nuclear war russia   then secret weapons   including superweapons   would unleashed smash russia take world   when set grand plan motion 1961   rockefeller

coming nuclear war could ruin large areas northern hemisphere generations come   calculations right   southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected war   this music ears four rockefeller

devise attack plan neither could carried alone   the rockefeller group   built originally controlled bases   provided detailed intelligence best way attack   the russians enormous military machine provided muscle actually carry attack   it essential devise scheme would enable secret fleets south atlantic south pacific attacked   survival intact either fleet would leave bolshevik war plan still workable   military analysts concluded quickly direct assault new zealand facilities question   there combination commandos   frogmen   military force could possibly keep attack secret outside world   any attack new zealand bases would set war rockefellers russians want prevent   but situation south atlantic different matter   in way   greatest asset south georgia island also achilles   heel   the extreme isolation protected secrecy south georgia base also made covert military assault feasible   the key lay argentina long standing claims falkland islands   as i mentioned topic   1   rockefeller

argentine flag   the incident provided desired excuse argentine junta bring simmering 150 year old falklands dispute boil   from time time past   argentina claimed south georgia part falklands administered way britain   that argument flimsy came handy   it nothing new hear argentine leaders   hint really afoot   during late march   argentine military forces started assembling assault falklands     nothing new     thought british high command   argentina carried threatening maneuvers past many times   it believed   april 2 argentine forces unexpected   after many past false alarms   time actually invaded seized islands   all argentine public statements emphasized long standing historical claims falklands   good measure   next day small argentine force also seized far off south georgia island   the force small gave appearance initially side show argentina  s point view   however   small contingent 22 royal marines overpowered bundled island along group 13 alleged scientists   that moment payoff joint rockefeller russian attack plan   thanks elaborate distraction staged argentine forces   special commando team got onto island undetected   based detailed rockefeller
